# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to My Personal Website

## 🎯 What's This All About?
This is my digital playground where I showcase my journey, project. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and a sprinkle of Tailwind CSS magic.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js** - Because React wasn't complicated enough
- **TypeScript** - For when JavaScript just isn't type-safe enough
- **Tailwind CSS** - Making me look like I know design
- **AOS** - For those fancy scroll animations
- **React Icons** - Because emojis are so 2020
